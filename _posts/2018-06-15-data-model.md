###Model View Controller
The Model View-Controller diagram separates objects in an app into 3 groups:
  1. **Model objects** - contain data and any operations on the data
  2. **View objects** - visual objects, ex: images, buttons, labels, text fields, table views, etc.
  3. **Controller objects** - connects data model objects to the views
