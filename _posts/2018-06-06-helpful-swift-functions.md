title: "Helpful Swift Functions"

This is just a page where I am going to store Swift functions that I have come across,
and think I may use in the future.  Kind of just a personal cheat sheet.

```
print()
```
Prints string parameters

```
let alert = UIAlertController(title: "An Alert", message: "Alert message", preferredStyle: .alert)
```
